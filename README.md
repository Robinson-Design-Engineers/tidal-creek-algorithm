# tidal-creek-algorithm

Repository for the semi-automated tidal creek extraction algorithm developed by Chirol et al. 2018. Used in Summer 2024 for the Ashleyville marsh project. The original algorithm was built in MATLAB. This repository mimics the code in Python. Several functions have been reworked, but the overall functionality is maintained.
